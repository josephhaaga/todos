Add instance directory so users can list/add todos from anywhere (e.g. ~/.todos)
    * See "Python Quickstart | Calendar API | Google Developers" page for example on elegantly handling/creating this application directory

add generate_report(date) to summarize tasks worked on in a given day, to make JIRA time logs easier

add statistics

add fill_calendar functionality
    * suggest how-best to allocate my time
    * estimate what date I will complete all my todo items 
    * group semantically similar items (e.g. "work on OneDash" should occur right before "OneDash Office Hours" so it's fresh in my head, and to minimize "switching gears")

fix timezone info for started_at, completed_at, and inserted_at
    * currently using a different timezone; or consider UTC time?

utility script to walk thru a source code directory and add these TODO comments to the database! And supplement them with info about where they were found!

function to view current status (e.g. timer showing elapsed time on IN_PROGRESS todos)

lowercase all tags and convert spaces into dashes (to standardize tags)

Add ability to list available tags

todo list should default to in-progress
        * --all flag option should allow users to view all todos


I should be able to pipe long-running command results to a Slack message
    * e.g. Slack the output of Nimbus deploy to San/Krishna without requiring me to watch the terminal and use Slack manually

Add a 'todo next' command to tell me the next task I should be working on 

Add a Tags collection so we can persist Tag foreground/background colors
